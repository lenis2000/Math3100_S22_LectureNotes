\section{Lecture 1. January 19}

Introductory lecture, just saying hello to the students.

\section{Lecture 2. No deadline}

Section 1.1

A recording of an in-class piece, explaining 
the definition of the
probability space $\Omega$, events $\mathcal{F}$, 
and probability measure $P(A)$.

\section{Lecture 3. January 21}

Sections 1.1--1.2.

\begin{itemize}
	\item 
Recalling $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},P)$. 
\item 
Finite sample spaces, when it is 
enough to specify $P(\left\{ \omega \right\})$ for each singleton $\omega\in \Omega$.
We only need to have $P(\left\{ \omega \right\})\ge0$ and $\sum_{\omega\in \Omega}P\left( \left\{ \omega \right\} \right)=1$
\item Biased coin, 2 flips --- example
\item Equally likely outcomes, $P(A)=\frac{\# A}{\#\Omega}$. 
\item Example with urns.
\end{itemize}

\section{Lecture 4. January 24}

Section 1.2. Discussing 3 settings,
when we sample $k$ times from $n$ objects. This is an instance of equally likely
outcomes.
Recall the factorial:
\begin{equation*}
	\begin{cases}
		n!=1\cdot 2\cdot 3\cdot \ldots\cdot n,&n\ge1 
		\\
		0!=1.
	\end{cases}
\end{equation*}
So, $0!=1$, $1!=1$, $2!=2$, $3!=6$, $4!=24$, and so on.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Sampling with replacement, order matters: $\# \Omega_k=n^k$.
	\item Sampling without replacement, order matters: $\# \Omega_k=n(n-1)\ldots (n-k+1)=\dfrac{n!}{(n-k)!}$.
	\item Sampling without replacement, order does not matter:
		$$\# \Omega_k=\dfrac{n(n-1)\ldots(n-k+1) }{k!}
		=\dfrac{n!}{k!\, (n-k!)}=\binom nk .$$
		The quantity $\binom nk$ has a special name, ``binomial coefficient''.
\end{itemize}

\section{Lecture 5. January 26}

Section 1.3.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Probability space for rolling a die until you see a ``6''
	\item How to sum the geometric progression
	\item Continuous sample spaces, $[0,1]$ with length measure
	\item How to draw a random line in the plane (one example)
\end{itemize}

\section{Lecture 6. January 28}

Section 1.4. Rules of probability (theory only).
\begin{itemize}
	\item Venn diagrams. Probability ``behaves like the area of a Venn diagram''
	\item Decomposing an event
	\item Complements, also $P(A)=P(AB)+P(AB^c)$
	\item Monotonicity of probability
	\item Inclusion-exclusion
\end{itemize}

\section{Lecture 6. January 31}
Section 1.4. Examples on rules of probability --- inclusion/exclusion principle; helpful passing to 
the complement event
$A^c$.

A first look on random variables: if we flip a fair coin 5 times, and let $Y$ be the number of Heads, 
what is the probability distribution of $Y$? This is described in terms of the probability mass function,
which in this case takes the form
\begin{equation*}
	P(Y=0)=\frac{1}{32},\quad
	P(Y=1)=\frac{5}{32},\quad
	P(Y=2)=\frac{10}{32},\quad
	P(Y=3)=\frac{10}{32},\quad
	P(Y=4)=\frac{5}{32},\quad
	P(Y=5)=\frac{1}{32}.
\end{equation*}
